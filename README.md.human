# TODO make a proper README.md out of this wall of text

The `summarai` project combines two ideas:

The `summarai` project is showcases how easy and quickly one can develop LLM applications
using LLM dev support. We're using Visual Studio Code and the Claude Dev plugin (requires Anthropic API key and credits)
in this case, to invoke local llamafile API:s, together with combinations of shell commands, to provide various types of
summaries of files and content on a computer.

Additionally, `summarai` showcases a simple use case of llamafile, an LLM packaging which allows inference at fair token rates
using consumer hardware to complete meaningful tasks in isolated environments with higher information security requirements.

This is the "seed" README.md from which we will grow the rest of this code fractal, using human instructions to Claude Dev.

MIT license, will produce code with MINIMAL dependencies. Even making API calls should be done natively.
