# summarai

## Overview

The `summarai` project is a demonstration of rapid LLM application development using advanced dev support tools. It showcases the power of combining Visual Studio Code with the Claude Dev plugin (requires Anthropic API key and credits) to interact with local llamafile APIs, alongside various shell commands. The primary goal is to provide different types of summaries for files and content on a computer.

## Key Features

1. **Rapid LLM Application Development**: Demonstrates the ease and speed of developing LLM applications with modern tools.
2. **llamafile Showcase**: Highlights the capabilities of llamafile, an LLM packaging solution that enables:
   - Inference at competitive token rates using consumer hardware
   - Completion of meaningful tasks in isolated environments
   - Enhanced information security for sensitive applications

## Technology Stack

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **AI Assistant**: Claude Dev plugin (Anthropic)
- **Local LLM**: llamafile APIs
- **Additional Tools**: Various shell commands for file and content manipulation

## Getting Started

(TODO: Add installation instructions, prerequisites, and basic usage guide)

## Use Cases

The `summarai` project is particularly useful for:

1. Developers looking to understand LLM application development workflows
2. Organizations requiring secure, isolated LLM solutions
3. Researchers exploring efficient LLM deployment on consumer hardware

## Future Development

This project serves as a starting point for further exploration and development in the field of LLM applications. We welcome contributions and ideas to expand its capabilities and use cases.
